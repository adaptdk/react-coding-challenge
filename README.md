# My solution for `Adapt React Coding Challenge`
All steps was acomplished but not in nice way. There are much to be improvment.
Still this quiz was interesting for me and give me opportunity to remember how to work with react.

What should be done (what kind of improvement must be done):

* Decouple code by using flux architecture. Such pattern should seperate view from logic
* Implement error handling in case if api server will not respond
* Refactor code
* and much more ... :(

# How to run

I'm usin SystemJS for building jspm for dependency managament and live-server for serving application

First of all install dependencies:

* npm install && npm i --dev
* jspm install && jspm i --dev

Then run application:

* npm run start-api
* npm run start-ui
