# Adapt React Coding Challenge

Seems like you're trying out for a position at
[Adapt](https://adapt.dk/en) or you've found this and would like to
apply. Fork this repo and go at it ;)

Your goal is to set up a React application, where users will be able to
edit book info (and create new books, if you have enough time to
implement it). Once you are done with the challenge, please fire up a
Pull Request and we will get in touch.

## Brief

I am a user of the app and I want to create a book object and edit
previously provided info about it, so that my reading list can stay up
to date. The form should be split into three steps:

1.  Choose subject (one of the two).
2.  Depending on the selection in the first step, display a list of
    reading material. Choose one.
3.  When reading material chosen, display all the info that's available
    about the book in a form (meaning that the book info can be edited).

## Requirements

- All steps should be visible on the screen and changable at all times
  (when they are available -- step 1 when nothing is picked, step 1
  and 2 when step 1 is picked and step 1, 2 and 3 when step 2 is
  picked).

- You can use whatever libraries, task runners and build processes you
  like. React and plain JavaScript are the only requirements (ES6
  encouraged, but no TypeScript, CoffeeScript, etc). Redux is strongly
  encouraged if you see a need for it.

### Suggested order of completion

This depends on how much time you were given to accomplish the task.
Ideally you would provide a solution for each of the outlined steps
unless they are marked as optional.

1.  Data fetching from the api.
2.  Form steps logic.
3.  (optional) Saving the data.
4.  (optional) Styling (minor for a 2-3 h challenge, more if there's more time).

## API Usage

API can be launched using `npm start`. You will need to run `npm install` once starting working on the project to install dependencies.

| Endpoint                     | Result                                              |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| /books?subjects_like=Fiction | Lists all books that contain "Fiction" as a subject |
| /subjects                    | Lists all available subjects                        |
